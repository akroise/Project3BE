ðŸŒ¿ Git Branch Workflow Cheat Sheet (For FE & BE)
âœ… Setup (only once per repo)
# Make sure you are on main and up to date
git checkout main
git pull origin main

âœ… Create a new feature branch
# Replace <feature-name> with your feature
git checkout -b feature/<feature-name>

âœ… Work on your feature
# After making changes
git add .
git commit -m "Implement <feature-name>"

âœ… Push your feature branch to GitHub
git push -u origin feature/<feature-name>

âœ… Update your feature branch with latest main (if needed)
git checkout feature/<feature-name>
git pull origin main

âœ… Merge feature branch into main (after testing/PR review)
git checkout main
git pull origin main
git merge feature/<feature-name>
git push origin main

âœ… Delete branch (after merge, cleanup)
# Local delete
git branch -d feature/<feature-name>

# Remote delete
git push origin --delete feature/<feature-name>
